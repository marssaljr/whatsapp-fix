Privacy Policy

Last updated: 08-15-2024

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when using our Chrome extension.

1. Information Collected

Our extension does not collect any personally identifiable information. The extension interacts only with the content of the WhatsApp Web page to hide conversations in the sidebar when you are sharing your screen.

2. Use of Information

The extension uses the host permission for https://web.whatsapp.com/* solely to apply the functionality of hiding conversations on the WhatsApp Web interface. We do not collect or store any data beyond what is necessary to hide conversations on the current page.

3. Protection of Information

We do not store or transmit data to external servers. All operations are performed locally within the browser, and there is no sharing of data with third parties.

4. Permissions

The extension requests the host permission to interact with WhatsApp Web and the "activeTab" permission to access the active tab needed to apply visual modifications. These permissions are strictly used for the described purposes and not for any other reason.

5. Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.

6. Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the use of our extension, please contact us at marssaljr@gmail.com.
